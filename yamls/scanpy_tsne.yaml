  title: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding {VER}
  subtitle: Visualize the cells as points on a 2-D plane using t-SNE (tSNE)
  description: >
    This step calculates a lower-dimension embedding of the input assay using

    [t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
    (t-SNE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding),
    which tries to model

    the pairwise similarity between data point in the lower dimensional space.
    The backend uses Scanpy for the calculation.

  args:
    - type: seed
      injectInto: random_seed
      label: Random seed
      description: >-
        The calculation of t-SNE has certain randomness (the initial state is randomly generated),
        setting this seed to the same number ensures a reproducible plot for the same data.

        This parameter controls how distance is computed in the ambient space of the input data.
      choices:
        - value: euclidean
          label: Euclidean
        - value: manhattan
          label: Manhattan
        - value: chebyshev
          label: Chebyshev
        - value: minkowski
          label: Minkowski
        - value: correlation
          label: Correlation
      default: correlation
    - type: number
      injectInto: perplexity
      label: Perplexity
      description: >-
        The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that is used in other manifold learning algorithms. Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity. Consider selecting a value between 5 and 50. Different values can result in significantly different results. The perplexity must be less than the number of samples.
      number: 30.0
    - type: number
      injectInto: early_exaggeration
      label: Early exaggeration
      description: >-
        Controls how tight natural clusters in the original space are in the embedded space and how much space will be between them. For larger values, the space between natural clusters will be larger in the embedded space. Again, the choice of this parameter is not very critical. If the cost function increases during initial optimization, the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate might be too high.
      number: 30.0

      injectInto: coord_name
      label: Name of coordinates (default is t-SNE coordinates)
      description: >-
        In order to know the different t-SNE coordinates generated it is important to name them in each gbox.
      default: "t-SNE coordinates"
